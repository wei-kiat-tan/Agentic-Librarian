# GenAI repository

This repository contains GenAI content, including LLM, fine-tuning, RAG etc. The codes for such works are to be considered POC which should work on cloud platforms like GCP or AWS sagemaker but yet to be tested due to restrictions like funds or quota limits. RAG will feature using R-programming
